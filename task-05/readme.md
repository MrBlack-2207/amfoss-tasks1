# Hypertext Mockup Language
Well this task took me a lot of time to complete because I have no prior knowledge of html and css.I sat for 1.5-2 days to learn HTML and CSS,like just the basics of them.
I then started working on the task like adding background picture and adding spotify,youtube buttons to the top right.
I struggled alot for the "WE ARE" text.Aligning it in the way i wanted to was a hard task.That took a lot of time.
The shop part,I felt it easier than the home page for some reason.I did this in the reading room lol.Creating the product cards and navbar and buttons was easy task.But again aligning the picture inside the product card and adjusting them in a single page was sort of challenging.Took a lot of time.
I have edited and placed the product cards,png files,and text files as per what i inspected in Brave browser.So i kindly request you to view my task in brave.I have no time to change the pixels to ratios as i have to move on to other tasks.I hope you understand and be kind enough :)
