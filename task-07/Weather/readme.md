I found it relatively easy compared to crickey and pokedex tasks.But it consumed a lot of my time for me since my api key didn't work for a lot of time.I did in the last week so procrastinated alot.
I was already done with codes of json,js(almost) using a tutorial from youtube.But he tells only till knowing the weather in a certain constant location.But I had to understand the code and change everything in JS in way where it should take input from the user,for the location.
After few hardships i managed to do that as well.I then procrastinated for 1 more day and edited such a way where it shows the images of clouds when its cloudy in that location,and rain if its rainy,etc.
My addresses for those pictures didnt work for a while,but managed to solve that error after analysing a bit.
