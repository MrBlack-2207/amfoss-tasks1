Ah this was the hardest task for me.I started doing this from week 1 and ended it in the last week
I put almost a week into this task.I went through few of the tutorials in youtube for making a basic discord bot at first.Made the bot with all the appropriate permissions given to it.
Then I started with downloading all the essentials like beautiful scraper and all that.I first made the scraper.py and tried it on Amrita website,it scraped the data and worked perfectly fine.I thought,wow,its almost done.
Ofcourse i was wrong.I didnt even come to the main part.Then I tried making the bot.py and combining both these so that i get the same result when i run bot.py.It was sort of hard but not as hard as the next part where i had to search for hrml elements.Making csv file was slightly easier than finding livescore for me.I used pandas library to manipulate the data i got.
I actually stopped working on it when i got to know i have to search html elements and stuff,i came back to this after learning some html css for task-05.It didnt help much but i was familiar to those concepts.
After finding html elements in the last week of my praveshan,i kind of made little changes to the codes,though of adding new commands and stuff but I didnt want to search for more html elements so.I thought of displaying team's players and all but I dont have much time so I didnt start with that.At last after all that hassle I was done with this.Phew.
