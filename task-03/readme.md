# Hello World
So I'm pretty new to the coding stuff and it was a tough task for me to even write the logic for this.I had the logic in mind but I'm not much familiar with the syntaxes so it took a lot of time to write and debug my code.I started with C as I have watched CS50 lectures on C in the first week.
I then began to convert them to the other languages after googling their syntaxes.Was not that tough of a task,but my review on this is like,Why?I mean it doesn't make sense why you want people who knows basics of 10 languages
