However, there exists a profound aspiration within me, at least once in this lifetime, I yearn to embark upon the endeavor of crafting a game that exudes a level of coolness that is simply unparalleled.Badminton and chess have always been my go-to for relaxation and strategy. I'm thrilled at the prospect of being a part of the AMFOSS Club, where I believe my skills and passion can find a meaningful outlet.

## INTROSEPCTION
### WHY MUST YOU CHOOSE ME?
I am a newcomer to the realm of coding, lacking familiarity in this sphere of learning. However, I am characterized by an insatiable curiosity and an unyielding eagerness to embrace new knowledge.I've always been fascinated by what goes on behind the scenes of a computer screen. I enjoy digging into content, trying to find answers to my questions. This drive, coupled with my enthusiasm for technology and collaborative approach, make me a strong candidate for selection by AMFOSS.Additionally, I aim to join the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program, and AMFOSS, with its experienced GSoC participants, appears to be an excellent resource. Their insights would be invaluable. The prospect of being surrounded by like-minded individuals who are passionate about technology is incredibly enticing.

### WHAT'S MY PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?
I'm eager to enhance my knack for problem-solving, a skill I value greatly. At the same time, I'm keen on improving my web development abilities to a more advanced level. While I've been drawn to specific tasks, mentors have wisely advised me not to focus too narrowly on one skill. So, I'm eager to explore areas like creating bots and automation after getting into the club. Additionally, I'm determined to secure a noteworthy internship, a step that promises to brighten up my professional profile.

### HOW WOULD I CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I'm committed to giving back to the AMFOSS Club. Just as my seniors mentored me, I'll mentor juniors with the same dedication. I'm ready to go the extra mile, offering my full support in projects and beyond. Together, we'll make AMFOSS thrive.

### DO I HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS?
In my journey with AMFOSS, I encountered a spectrum of tasks, some of which were undeniably challenging. While a few seemed less impactful, such as the "hello world" exercise in multiple languages, others like the crickey, imagine dragons, and pokedex tasks, proved to be intellectually stimulating and immensely enlightening. Balancing my academic commitments and sleep schedule alongside these tasks was no small feat, but I understand that excellence demands such dedication. After all, AMFOSS stands as one of the premier clubs in the nation, and such high standards are what set it apart.
